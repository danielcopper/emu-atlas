"""Per-core mode-selection rules for cards no single option can govern.

A rule card (``governing_rule`` in ``data/core_oddities.json``) keeps its modes
as data — what *can* exist — and the function here, keyed by the card key, is
what decides which of them holds on this machine: it reads the options the
card declared, and whatever else it stated it needs (a content class, a config
file of the emulator's own), and returns the mode's name. Several interacting
options are a product no single option's value can name, so the format grows
code plus a card referencing it, never a DSL (issue #163).

The boundary rule holds unchanged: everything a rule decides on is read off
the running machine, handed in by the resolver through :class:`RuleReading`.
A rule that cannot decide returns no mode and says why, as structured
caveats — the card then steps aside exactly as it does for a generation
nobody could confirm, and the standard answer below says what it can.

The resolver records which of the declared options a rule actually consulted,
and those readings — plus any the rule adds itself, like ScummVM's
``savepath`` — become the answer's :class:`~atlas.placement.Granularity`
readings: the caller sees every switch that went into the selection, its
live value, and where to change it.
