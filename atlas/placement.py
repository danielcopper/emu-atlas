"""Placements — resolved directories, honest file sets, and provenance.

A :class:`SavefilePlacement` answers "where does this emulator, configured as it is,
keep the save for this content?"; a :class:`SavestatePlacement` answers the same
question for its savestates. Their shape follows the research findings
(``docs/research/retrodeck-save-placement.md`` §16):

- **Directory and file set are different kinds of knowledge.** The directory
  follows from RetroArch's central path rule and is always resolvable; the file
  set is per-core behaviour with no metadata source. For existing saves atlas
  *observes* the set (``glob("<rom_stem>.*")``); otherwise it is honestly
  ``unknown`` — never guessed. An observation in the ROM's own directory says so
  (``content-dir-observation``): there the content shares the name and no source
  tells the two apart. The old fixed ``<rom_stem>.srm`` filename is
  gone: ``.srm`` is only what RetroArch itself writes, and cores like Beetle
  Saturn write ``.bcr``/``.bkr``/``.smpc`` on their own.
- **A hole is not an unknown.** ``needs`` lists holes the caller fills from the
  content at hand (``content_dir``, ``library_name``, ``save_id``); *unknown*
  means atlas cannot state the value and refuses to guess. Distinct states,
  kept distinct. A hole is not confined to the directory: where a rule card
  names the save's files through the content's platform-native id, the file
  set is a template too and the same hole vocabulary carries it.
- **The root varies** — ``savefile_directory`` (explicit, or the RetroArch
  platform default when unset/reset), the system directory (Flycast VMUs), or
  the ROM's own directory (``savefiles_in_content_dir``). Sorting stages apply
  after root selection regardless of which root was chosen
  (``runloop.c:8785-8841``). The system directory is the one *the core is
  handed*, not the cfg key's value: ``systemfiles_in_content_dir`` — or a key
  cleared to nothing — sends the core to the content's own directory
  (``runloop.c:1958-1999``), so a card rooted there answers
  ``content_directory`` on those machines.
- **Filesystem state is part of the answer** — RetroArch silently reverts to the
  unsorted root when a sorted directory cannot be created (``runloop.c:8844``,
  and its savestate twin ``:8878-8887``); ``caveats`` carries that and every
  other stated degradation.

**Why savestates get their own type.** The directory math is shared to the line
— one upstream function resolves both families side by side
(``runloop.c:8752-8979``) — so the resolution is parameterized rather than
copied. What is *not* shared is the field set, and the reason is structural: the
libretro API hands a core no savestate directory at all (``libretro.h`` defines
``GET_SYSTEM_DIRECTORY``, ``GET_SAVE_DIRECTORY``, ``GET_CONTENT_DIRECTORY``,
``GET_PLAYLIST_DIRECTORY`` and ``GET_FILE_BROWSER_START_DIRECTORY``, and nothing
for states), and RetroArch serializes the state itself. A core therefore cannot
deviate from state placement, no rule card for it can ever exist, and
``granularity`` — which is a card's word about how a *core* groups the data it
writes — has an empty domain here. Carrying it as a permanent ``None`` would be
the blank field this grammar refuses, and it could not even be rescued by a
caveat: there is nothing to report. So :class:`SavestatePlacement` is
:class:`SavefilePlacement` minus that one field, the way :class:`RomPlacement`
already carries the fields its own question has and no others.

Pure compute. No I/O — the installation handles observe the machine and pass
the results in.

    A save is not always one list of files in one place. MAME keeps a machine's
    battery memory under ``nvram/``, its dip switches under ``cfg/`` beside an
    emulator-wide ``default.cfg``, and disk write-differences under ``diff/``;
    FinalBurn Neo puts a per-game ``.fs`` and a ``shared.memcard`` in one
    directory. Those are different data with different owners, and a single
    ``(dir, files, granularity)`` triple has to lie about at least one of them.

    Each group carries its own resolved ``dir`` — groups may sit under different
    roots — its own ``granularity`` and its own ``role``. What a group never
    carries is prose: what a file is *for* beyond its role belongs in the
    answer's ``sources``, not in a field a client would have to parse.

    ``files`` is ``None`` where the emulator writes save data into this directory
    under names that follow from nothing atlas reads — MAME names a hard disk's
    differencing image after the disk's entry in the machine's own ROM table, and
    its memory cards after an index chosen in the emulator's own interface.
    ``None`` and ``()`` are different claims and the difference is the point:
    ``()`` would say *this directory holds nothing*, which is exactly what such a
    group does not say. Read it as "there is save data here and I cannot list
    it": a backup takes the directory whole, and a name-based sync knows it is
    blind there instead of silently skipping the player's progress. The reason
    travels beside the answer as ``file-names-unestablished``, which carries the
    citation; the group is where the directory itself belongs, so that one walk
    over ``groups`` reaches every place a save lives.

    ``"declared"`` (``files`` come from a verified rule card — world knowledge
    with cited provenance, not a guess), or ``"unknown"`` (``files`` is empty;
    atlas refuses to guess). ``provenance`` says how the state was reached.

    A declared set can itself be a template: where the card names the files
    through the content's own id, the names keep their ``<save_id>`` hole and
    :data:`SavefilePlacement.needs` lists it. Stating the shape in full is not the
    same as claiming the resolved name — it is the directory grammar applied to
    file names.

    *Observed* means a snapshot of matching files currently seen — it never
    implies the whole save. ``complete`` is the explicit completeness claim:
    ``True`` only when a source-verified rule card closes the candidate
    universe for the active mode; the generic observation can never earn it.

    **Today the field is reserved: it is ``False`` on every answer atlas can
    give**, because no shipped rule card claims completeness and none can yet.
    Closing the candidate universe means establishing which files the core can
    write *at all* for the active mode — an upstream read, not an inventory of
    what a card happens to list — and no card's evidence goes that far. The
    field stays in the contract at its honest value rather than being dropped:
    a client must not read "not complete" as "atlas has no opinion", and the
    audit grind can earn a ``True`` here one card at a time without the shape
    of an answer changing.

    ``groups`` decomposes a declared set whose parts differ in kind or owner —
    see :class:`FileGroup`. It is empty wherever nothing decomposed the answer,
    which is every observation, every unknown and every standard-rule
    declaration; empty means *not decomposed*, never *no files*.

    Where it is populated, ``files`` stays exactly what it always was — the
    names lying in ``dir`` — and that is enforced: it must be every group under
    the first group's directory whose names are established, in order. So a
    client that never reads ``groups`` sees no change when a card splits one
    list into two by role, while a client that does gets the parts under the
    other directories too. Cards state the save's own state first, so the first
    group is the one a save-syncing client would have taken anyway.

    **``groups`` is the complete list of places, and ``files`` is one of them.**
    A group whose names are not established carries ``files=None`` and still
    appears here, so a single walk over ``groups`` reaches every directory the
    card knows about — there is no second structure to correlate. A group with
    ``None`` contributes nothing to ``files``, which is what keeps the flat list
    exactly the set of names a caller can look for.

    ``continuations`` are the indexed follow-ups applied on top of it once it
    hits — the same name with one digit appended, 1 through 9, stopping at the
    first gap (``task_patch.c:1121-1147``). They are listed rather than
    described because they *are* file names: a rule for composing them would
    hand a client the one piece of upstream arithmetic this answer exists to
    have done for it.

    ``attempted`` says whether the RetroArch on this machine tries this format
    at all, and it is ``None`` wherever nobody established that — the flags are
    compile-time (:data:`CAVEAT_PATCH_FORMATS_UNESTABLISHED`) and no read of a

class SoftPatchAnswer:
    """Which files RetroArch would patch this content with, before any core sees it.

    The family's second question, and the only one whose subject is the
    **content** rather than an emulator: soft patching is the frontend's own,
    it has no directory of its own — the files sit beside the ROM — and no
    configuration key anywhere governs it (a grep for ``soft_patching`` over
    the pinned tree finds none; the one patch-related setting,
    ``notification_show_patch_applied``, governs an on-screen message). What
    could change it is a command line — ``--ips=``/``--bps=``/``--ups=``/
    ``--xdelta=`` force one format, ``--no-patch`` blocks patching entirely
    (``retroarch.c:7458-7465``, consumed ``task_content.c:695-696``,
    ``:1203-1204``) — and no launcher on either arrangement passes one.

    So this answer is exact where the rest of the family hedges: ``candidates``
    is the whole candidate set in attempt order, derived from the content path
    by arithmetic atlas ports rather than from anything it had to look up.

    ``applies`` is the one live per-core reading: RetroArch patches only content
    it loads **into memory**, which is every core that does not need a full path
    (``task_content.c:744-745`` sets the flag from the core's own
    ``retro_system_info.need_fullpath``, ``:1736-1737`` puts it on the content
    element, ``:1469`` skips the memory load — and with it the patch call at
    ``:1195-1215`` — when it is set). ``True`` means this core loads into memory
    and is therefore patched, ``False`` means it never is, ``None`` means atlas
    could not establish it: no core was named, or the core's ``.info`` states no
    ``needs_fullpath``, or it could not be read (which says so in a caveat).

    Two further gates ride every ``True`` and are stated in prose rather than in
    fields, because neither is a fact about this machine: only the **first**
    content file is patched (``idx == 0``), and only when it is not a media type
    (``first_content_type == RARCH_CONTENT_NONE``, ``task_content.c:1195-1198``).
    A single-file launch — what every launcher on both arrangements performs —
    meets both.

    **Nothing here is written to disk.** The patch is applied to the in-memory
    buffer the core is handed (``task_patch.c:872-879``); the ROM beside the
    patch file is not modified, and no answer of atlas's is a statement that it
    will be.
