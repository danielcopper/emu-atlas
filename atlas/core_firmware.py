"""How a core finds the firmware it boots — the fact a declaration cannot state.

A libretro ``.info`` lists names. It cannot say whether those names are what
the core actually opens, and the difference decides what a missing file means:
a core that opens ``scph5501.bin`` and nothing else is answered by that name,
while one that falls back to reading every file in the directory and
recognising it by its bytes may boot from a file the declaration never
mentions. Both shapes are deployed, and until this module existed an answer
reproduced the declaration for both and left a consumer to guess which it had.

So every core states :data:`FirmwareLocating` — one word for the door the
emulator uses. For a libretro core the word comes from this module's packaged
knowledge file (``atlas/data/core_firmware.json``, one entry per ``.so`` short
name, every fact carrying its own citation); a core with no entry answers
``unestablished``, which is a claim about atlas rather than about the core. For
a standalone emulator it comes from the shape of its own card
(:func:`locating_of_card`), because a card already says which door it
describes.

The word is world knowledge — written nowhere on the machine, read out of
upstream source at a pinned revision — so it is packaged, versioned and cited
the way ``atlas/data/system_firmware.json`` is, and never derived from a
reading of this installation. The method and the evidence behind each entry
are in ``docs/research/core-firmware-locating.md``.

:data:`FIRMWARE_LOCATING` carries only words something here can produce. A
value no entry states and no rule returns is a claim with no mechanism behind
it, and a consumer branching on it would be writing a branch nothing reaches.
The list therefore grows with the readings rather than ahead of them — which
costs nothing, because adding a value is a compatible change and removing one
is not. A core read to search a directory while naming no file at all would be
a new word, added then.
