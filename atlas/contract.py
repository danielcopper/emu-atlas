"""The canonical serialization of atlas results — the portable contract.

One JSON-shaped form per result type, used by the conformance vectors
(``vectors/``, schema 2) and available to consumers who want answers as plain
data. The rule for what serializes:

- **Structured fields are contractual**: directories, root kinds, holes,
  file-set state/files/completeness, granularity values and option identity,
  caveat codes and caveat data, installation identity, and health findings —
  which are caveats and serialize as caveats, code and data alike. Vectors
  assert them with exact equality; ports must reproduce them.
- **Prose is not**: ``sources``, caveat ``message``, ``option_provenance``,
  ``FileSet.provenance`` and ``EmulatorSpec.provenance`` are human-readable
  explanations and may change freely — they are deliberately absent here. Two
  words, two scopes: ``sources`` is what a whole answer was read from,
  ``*provenance`` is where one field's own value came from.
  ``FirmwareRequirement.system_source`` is neither and keeps its name: it is a
  closed vocabulary naming *which rule* assigned the system (an override, the
  core's ``systemname``, a slug, or nothing), so it is data a client branches
  on and it serializes.

A port that reproduces these dicts for every vector reads the machine the way
the reference does.

    "atlas knows nothing about this core", ``satisfied`` says whether one file
    is actually usable (a *present* file with the wrong bytes is not), and
    ``requirements_met`` is the single number a client renders — never ``true``
    out of ignorance, never ``true`` with a required file known to be wrong.
    Two limits of it belong next to each other, because a consumer that renders
    only this field cannot see either:

    - With ``hash_checked`` false it is ``null`` wherever a required file's
      identity is known and was not verified. Presence is not the question the
      field asks; a caller who wants a green light passes ``verify``.
    - It can be ``true`` over a required file the packaged table does not cover
      at all (``checked`` ``unknown`` with ``identity`` ``null``). Nothing
      further can ever be established about such a file, so withholding the
      answer would withhold it forever — but "in place under the right name" is
      all that was checked. On the reference machine that is three requirements
      across two cores (blueMSX's databases and machine ROMs, Dolphin's
      ``codehandler.bin``).
    ``found`` is the path kind actually read, which ``present`` alone cannot
    carry (a directory at the destination is not a missing file), and
    ``refused`` names declarations atlas would not follow, with the reason,
    so a dropped file can never make a core look complete. ``path`` is the
    **resolved** destination and ``declared`` the string the core spelled: two
    declarations that land on one file are one place, and the name the core
    opens is still stated.

    A core's ``requirements`` list is a conjunction, and one entry may be an
    ``alternatives`` group instead of a requirement — see
    :func:`_requirement_entry_contract`: a launch needs the option whose
    ``regions`` contain its console region, which is the running disc's own
