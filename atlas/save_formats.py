"""What each emulator's save files hold, as packaged knowledge — the facts the save-portability question compares.

A save answer says where an entry keeps a game's save and which files make it
up. Whether another entry can read those files is a question about their
*contents*, and nothing on the machine states it: it is read out of each
emulator's source at a pinned build, so it is world knowledge, packaged here
(``atlas/data/save_formats.json``) with a citation per fact and a pin per
emulator (#577 D5).

The knowledge is stated per emulator, never per pair. Each record labels the
file groups of that emulator's own save answer, mode by mode: which memory of
the console a file holds (:data:`SAVE_MEMORIES`), which slot, and its
**format** — an identity string two records share exactly where the sources
say the bytes are laid out alike. A pair's verdict is then computed from the
two records and the two save answers (:mod:`atlas.save_portability`), so a
system with *n* entries needs *n* records rather than a table of every pair.
The few ways one format turns into another that a source states are listed
apart, as conversions.

The method and the evidence are in ``docs/research/save-portability.md``.
